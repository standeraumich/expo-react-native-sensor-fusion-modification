# react-native-sensor-fusion

by [cawfree](https://github.com/cawfree/react-native-sensor-fusion)

## This repo is a modification of react-native-sensor-fusion in order to make it work with the Expo framework. Implementation is still the same, the rest of the Readme is left the same

Robust absolute 3D positioning in React Native, using [sensor fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor_fusion) to exploit the superior characterstics of the device Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer, whilst mitigating against their negative qualities.

Physical data acquisition is implemented using [react-native-sensors](https://github.com/react-native-sensors/). The noise in sampled data is filtered from the input signals using the high quality [kalmanjs](https://github.com/wouterbulten/kalmanjs), and sensor fusion is calculated using [ahrs](https://github.com/psiphi75/ahrs).

## 🚀 Getting Started

Using [`npm`]():

```sh
npm install --save react-native-sensor-fusion
```

Using [`yarn`]():

```sh
yarn add react-native-sensor-fusion
```

## ✍️ Example

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Text } from 'react-native';
import SensorFusionProvider, { useSensorFusion, useCompass, toDegrees } from 'react-native-sensor-fusion';

const Indicator = () => {
  const { ahrs } = useSensorFusion();  
  const { x, y, z, w } = ahrs.toVector();
  return (
    <Text
      children={toDegrees(z)}
    />
  );

const Indicator = () => {
  const { ahrs } = useSensorFusion();
  const { heading, pitch, roll } = ahrs.getEulerAngles();
  const compass = useCompass();
  return (
    <Text>
      Heading: {toDegrees(heading)}°{'\n'}
      Pitch: {toDegrees(pitch)}°{'\n'}
      Roll: {toDegrees(roll)}°{'\n'}
      Compass: {toDegrees(compass)}°{'\n'}
    </Text>
  );
};

export default () => (
  <SensorFusionProvider>
    <Indicator />
  </SensorFusionProvider>
);
```

## 📌 Prop Types

-----
Prop                  | Type     | Default                   | Required | Description
--------------------- | -------- | ------------------------- | -------- | -----------
sampleInterval|number|60|No|The frequency to sample the device sensors in Hz.
algorithm|string|'Mahony'|No|Choose from the `Madgwick` or `Mahony` filter.
beta|number|0.4|No|The filter noise value, smaller values have smoother estimates, but have higher latency. This only works for the `Madgwick` filter.
kp|number|0.5|No|The filter noise values for the `Mahony` filter (Proportional).
ki|number|0|No|The filter noise values for the `Mahony` filter (Integral).
